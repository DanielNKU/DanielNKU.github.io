I am currently a doctoral student in the College of Computer Science at Nankai University, where my research centers on secure key management, identity authentication protocols, and provable security. My supervisors are Prof. [Ding Wang](https://wangdingg.weebly.com/). I received my Bachelor’s degree from Nankai University in 2018.
